# Hi there, I'm JidÃ© Tidjani-Serpos! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Full-Stack Developer.

With over 10 years of experience in product design and a master's in business management.

Currently, I am spearheading the development of a comprehensive design system for a leading Canadian financial institution, leveraging Figma, Angular, and HTML, alongside Storybook and Chromatic. 

Starting September 2024, I am available for contract opportunities and keen to lend my skills to product design and full stack development endeavors in diverse digital projects. Letâ€™s collaborate for success.
